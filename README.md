# SqlcTutorial

A quick look at Sqlc, a nice sql generator for golang. Specifically, this repo looks over [this tutorial](https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/stable/tutorials/getting-started-sqlite.html). Almost all of the code is from this tutorial, not my own, although I have altered bits and pieces in playing around with it.
